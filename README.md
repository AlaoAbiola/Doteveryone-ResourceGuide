## Resource Guide


***Disclaimer**: We do not currently know how the final product of this guide will be packaged, disseminated or scaled. 

### Introduction

We need a movement towards a responsible technology mindset where those who create and own technology look not only at individual people in one aspect of their lives, but recognise that both their users and technology don’t exist in isolation.  This isn’t about tech for good or ethics, this is about a basic responsibility and expectation that technologies do not create or deepen existing inequalities, recognise and respect everyone’s rights and dignity, and give people trust and confidence in their use.

####  The 3 Cs of Responsible Technology

Teams that create responsible technology products will strive to consider these core concepts: 

**Context** - looking beyond the individual user and taking into account the wider world a technology product or service exists within

**Contribution** - sharing how value is created in a transparent and understandable way

**Consequences** - Being aware of, and looking at mitigating the potential ways technology can have unintended consequences 

This is a resource guide to accompany a greater number of practical tools currently being developed by [Doteveryone](http://doteveryone.org.uk) to motivate and support businesses to develop technology responsibly.  

### Responsible Business

While our responsible technology system focuses on specific technology products or services, the business model and the ownership and control of the organisation are equally important parts of ensuring technology is created responsibly. 

The business model and organisational structure should be appropriate for the product or services being offered. That might mean an organisation being a social enterprise, worker owned co-operative, or a B corp, or it might be a conventional for-profit company or corporate, or a public body. 

It will be clear that the value given and received by different stakeholders is reasonable for the type of product or service. Stakeholders include those who control or own or benefit from the organisation, as well as workers, users, partners, etc, and these should be considered in light of the business model, meaning who pays for what and related choices around customers, suppliers, intellectual property and other assets, and investors.

It’s particularly important that the business model is clear if it is based around hard to perceive things, such as repackaging, licensing or selling data or insights from it. 

The organisation creating the product or service will be established in an appropriate location or locations, and will of course follow local and international laws, pay required taxes, and should also consider international business conventions and guides to proper conduct as defined by the United Nations.  

There needs to be some sort of structure which can be responsible for the product or service and can be held liable if there are problems (this might be harder for a purely free open source collaboration without structure).
