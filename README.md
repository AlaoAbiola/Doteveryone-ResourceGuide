## Resource Guide


***Disclaimer**: We do not currently know how the final product of this guide will be packaged, disseminated or scaled. 

### Introduction

We need a movement towards a responsible technology mindset where those who create and own technology look not only at individual people in one aspect of their lives, but recognise that both their users and technology don’t exist in isolation.  This isn’t about tech for good or ethics, this is about a basic responsibility and expectation that technologies do not create or deepen existing inequalities, recognise and respect everyone’s rights and dignity, and give people trust and confidence in their use.

####  The 3 Cs of Responsible Technology

Teams that create responsible technology products will strive to consider these core concepts: 

**Context** - looking beyond the individual user and taking into account the wider world a technology product or service exists within

**Contribution** - sharing how value is created in a transparent and understandable way

**Consequences** - Being aware of, and looking at mitigating the potential ways technology can have unintended consequences 

This is a resource guide to accompany a greater number of practical tools currently being developed by [Doteveryone](http://doteveryone.org.uk) to motivate and support businesses to develop technology responsibly.
